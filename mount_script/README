This script is a quality of life script
to improve the process of mounting a remote disk.
Instead of hassling with several commands and checking
whether the disk is mounted or not, you can simply
choose the reset option from the menu and everything else 
is automated (you will still be prompted for required passwords).

The mounting commands are run with switches to attempt to automatically 
reconnect in case of temporary disconnection (in case of poor internet).
