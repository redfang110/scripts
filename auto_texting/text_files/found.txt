I, I found life
When I found You
When I found You
Now, now I'm trying
To make it through
To make it through
Done with all of the lies
I might not win
But I'm gonna try
All the times that I cried
I know You were there
Holding me tight
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
All of the days that I thought
That I'd never get through
Searching for answers
All along it was You
Sorry for all of the times
That I ignored You
I can't imagine a moment
To be without You
I, I found life
When I found You
When I found You
Now, now I'm trying
To make it through
To make it through
