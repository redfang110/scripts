This program is designed mostly for practical jokes, 
but has some theoretically useful application. 

The program spams texts from a predetermined text file 
to a predetermined number line by line (one line at a time). 
This means you can have a whole movie script copy/pasted
into a text file, run the script, and watch thousands
of texts send to the inputted number one at a time.

The program runs a menu which asks the user whether they would like to 
- Add contact to contact script
- Add message file to folder of message files
- Choose a file from library to text to a number from library
- Quit script
